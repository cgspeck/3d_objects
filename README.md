# 3D Objects

Repository of random designs which I would normally post to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com).

_Why?_

Thingiverse has been very unreliable of late, and I need a quick, convenient, reliable and off-site way of backing up and publishing my original 3D designs.

Also, a git repo naturally affords version tracking, which is quite useful when you can treat real objects as code.
